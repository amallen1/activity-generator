### What I learned

This mini project helped me to understand how to use the fetch api to make a request for data, to receive that data, and make use of it in my own application. I wanted to do this project to reinforce my learning about APIs and I was able to practice using Adobe xD to come up with a quick design for the application. I also deepened my understanding of using Javascript to manipulate the DOM to show the results that I wanted.

### Continued development

In the future I might add a todo list as an extra feature to the app so that as users are suggested things to do, they can actually store those suggestions somewhere to consider them for later.

I also want to fix the responsiveness of the app because it looks fine on mobile but has some issues as it transition to desktop.
